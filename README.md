## Description

My motive for this project was to apply my knowledge of events and keycodes in reference to javascript. There are multiple ways to apply events, including using the keyboard. 

## Learned
This whole project was made with vanilla javascript. This project allowed me to sharpen my skills utilizing events. I gained a better understanding of event handling and keyboard events. With this app I got a great review of JS event objects and handling.  

## Usage
How to Use:
- Press any key to get the keycode.
